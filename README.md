This is a Python-based command-line tool designed to simplify the process of finding and downloading research articles from the Nepal Journals Online (NepJol) database. It automates the web scraping process, allowing users to search for articles by keywords and download the full-text PDFs directly to their local machine.

You can also add a "Features" section with bullet points to highlight what the script can do:

    Search for articles on NepJol using keywords.

    Display search results including article titles, authors, and sources.

    Download full-text PDF articles.

    Handle dynamic redirects to find the correct PDF download links.
